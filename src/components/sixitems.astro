                <p>We do slow fashion itâ€™s a sustainable approach to production and it emphasizes
                    customization and minimizes waste. When a customer places an order for a piece of jewelry,
                    it is
                    crafted
                    by hand specifically for that customer.</p>

                <h3>CRAFTSMANSHIP</h3>
                <p>Every piece is crafted by hand, focusing on creating jewelry that is long-lasting, raises
                    awareness,
                    and aims to be as sustainable as possible.
                    All of our jewelry is created in sterling silver, as we wish for it to be as long-lasting
                    and
                    sustainable as possible.</p>

                <p>We produce locally produced products so we have less distance to travel to the consumer,
                    which
